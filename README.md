# Concert Finder

This is a simple node.js command line script that locates concerts by artists matching entries in a specified set. If/when the Spotify API permits, I intend the script to pull a list of artists you follow to populate the set. For now, the set is just hardcoded. 

###Run it like this:
node ConcertFinder.js [zipcode] [radius] [start-date] [end-date]
